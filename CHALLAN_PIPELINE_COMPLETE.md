# 🚀 CHALLAN PIPELINE - COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION

## ✅ ALL 6 FILES DELIVERED & TESTED

Your Traffic Violation Management System now has a **complete, production-ready Challan Pipeline** with strict role separation and native database automation.

## 📁 FILE 1: `db/database_triggers.sql` ✅

### Native MySQL Triggers - Auto-Reward & Auto-Penalty System

**Trigger 1: `Auto_Reward_System`**
- **Event**: `AFTER UPDATE ON REPORTS`
- **Condition**: `OLD.status = 'Pending'` AND `NEW.status = 'Verified'`
- **Action**: 
  - Adds **+10** to `CITIZENS.trust_score`
  - Adds **+10** to `CITIZENS.reward_points`

**Trigger 2: `Auto_Penalty_System`**
- **Event**: `AFTER UPDATE ON REPORTS`
- **Condition**: `OLD.status = 'Pending'` AND `NEW.status = 'Rejected'`
- **Action**: 
  - Subtracts **-10** from `CITIZENS.trust_score` (minimum 0)

**✅ Status**: Successfully installed and verified (2/2 triggers active)

## 📁 FILE 2: `server/routes/reports.py` ✅

### Updated Police Process Endpoint - Full Challan Pipeline

**Endpoint**: `PUT /api/reports/police/process/{report_id}`

**Request Payload**:
```json
{
  "status": "Verified",
  "rule_id": 1,
  "badge_no": "MH01POL123"
}
```

**The Complete Pipeline** (All in One Transaction):

1. **Validate** report exists and is `Pending`
2. **UPDATE** REPORTS status to `Verified` or `Rejected`
3. **If Verified**:
   - Lookup `VIOLATION_RULES` to get `base_fine_amount`
   - **INSERT** into `VIOLATION_EVENTS` → get `event_id`
   - **INSERT** into `CHALLANS` with:
     - `total_amount` = rule's `base_fine_amount`
     - `payment_status` = `'Unpaid'`
     - `due_date` = 30 days from now
   - Return `event_id`, `challan_id`, and `fine_amount`

**✅ Status**: Tested - Successfully creates violation events and challans

---

## 📁 FILE 3: `server/routes/challans.py` ✅

### Citizen Payment Router - Self-Contained

**Endpoint 1: `GET /api/challans/citizen/{citizen_id}`**
- 4-table JOIN: `CHALLANS` → `VIOLATION_EVENTS` → `REPORTS` → `VIOLATION_RULES`
- Returns: Challan ID, Rule Name, Plate No, Amount, Payment Status, Issue/Due Dates

**Response Example**:
```json
{
  "message": "Challans fetched successfully",
  "count": 2,
  "challans": [
    {
      "challan_id": 1,
      "rule_name": "Speeding",
      "rule_code": "VR001",
      "plate_no": "KA01AB1234",
      "total_amount": 1000.00,
      "payment_status": "Unpaid",
      "issue_date": "2026-04-25",
      "due_date": "2026-05-25"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Endpoint 2: `PUT /api/challans/pay/{challan_id}`**
- Updates `payment_status` to `'Paid'`
- Sets `paid_at` timestamp
- Generates `transaction_ref` (e.g., `TXN1745678901`)

**Response Example**:
```json
{
  "message": "Payment successful",
  "challan_id": 1,
  "amount_paid": 1000.00,
  "payment_status": "Paid"
}
```

**✅ Status**: Tested - 200 OK, returns structured data

## 📁 FILE 4: `server/routes/vehicles.py` ✅

### Police Vehicle Search Router - Self-Contained

**Endpoint: `GET /api/vehicles/search/{plate_no}`**

- Searches `VEHICLES` table for owner details
- JOINs `VIOLATION_EVENTS` → `VIOLATION_RULES` → `CHALLANS`
- Returns vehicle info + complete violation history + summary statistics

**Response Example**:
```json
{
  "message": "Vehicle search successful",
  "vehicle": {
    "plate_no": "KA01AB1234",
    "owner_name": "John Doe",
    "vehicle_type": "Car",

    "unpaid_challans": 2,
    "total_unpaid_amount": 2500.00
  },
  "violations": [
    {
      "event_id": 5,
      "rule_name": "Speeding",
      "rule_code": "VR001",
      "severity": "Moderate",
      "challan_id": 3,
      "total_amount": 1000.00,
      "payment_status": "Unpaid",

## 🔄 COMPLETE WORKFLOW

### Citizen Reports Violation:
1. Citizen submits report → `POST /api/reports/create`
2. Report status = `'Pending'`
3. **No challan created yet**

### Police Verifies Report:
1. Police reviews pending reports
2. Clicks "Approve" with `rule_id` and `badge_no`
3. `PUT /api/reports/police/process/{report_id}`
4. **Backend automatically**:
   - Updates report status to `'Verified'`
   - Creates `VIOLATION_EVENT` record
   - Creates `CHALLAN` with fine amount from rule
   - Sets payment status to `'Unpaid'`
   - Sets due date to 30 days
5. **Trigger fires**: `Auto_Reward_System` adds +10 to citizen's trust score

### Citizen Pays Challan:
1. Citizen opens Dashboard → sees unpaid challans
2. Clicks "💳 Pay Fine" button
3. `PUT /api/challans/pay/{challan_id}`
4. Challan marked as `'Paid'`
5. Transaction reference generated
6. Dashboard refreshes, shows ✓ Paid

### Police Searches Vehicle:
1. Police opens Vehicle Search page
2. Enters plate number (e.g., `KA01AB1234`)
3. `GET /api/vehicles/search/KA01AB1234`
4. Sees vehicle owner details + complete violation history
5. Summary shows unpaid challans and total amount due
